# Data Structures & Algorithms in C++

This repo is my space to rebuild and explore core data structures and algorithms â€” but this time in C++.

I'm currently going through a DSA course at university, and to keep it interesting (and useful), Iâ€™m implementing everything from scratch in C++. Iâ€™ve done a lot of this before in Python, but since Python and C++ are my two main languages, I figured this would be a good way to level up.

C++ gives me a more hands-on view of whatâ€™s really going on â€” especially with pointers, memory, and structure layouts. I mostly use C++ for CUDA and high-performance computing, so it just makes sense to build a strong base in DSA at this level too.

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside So Far

- `LinkedLists/`  
  - Singly linked list with head dummy node
  - Doubly linked list with head/tail dummy nodes

(Other folders coming soon: `Stacks/`, `Queues/`, `Trees/`, etc.)

## ðŸ§  Why this repo

It's about building a deep understanding of how stuff works. I wanted a clean space to play with DSA in C++ and maybe see the problems from a different angle than I did in Python.
