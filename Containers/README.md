# Containers

This directory holds general-purpose, sequence-based container data structures. These are fundamental building blocks for more complex structures and applications.

## Implemented Containers

-   **`DynamicArray`**: A template-based, cache-friendly, contiguous-memory array that can automatically resize itself. It aims to provide an interface similar to `std::vector` while demonstrating manual memory management and the "Rule of Five" to showcase core C++ principles.
